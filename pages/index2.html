    <br> <hr> <h3> This is the Instructions! </br>
    <br> The ball is placed under one of three cups, which are then moved each round.
    <br>it's up to you to make sure you choose the cup with the ball and click the cup image  when you are ready.</br>
     <br> Click the "start" button and begin playing. Once you played all the rounds of 10, you'll get your scores at the end. </br> As to keep your points, you can either keep in mind, write it down or use the two button to keep your points.
     but it's resets every round :/
    <br> <hr> For the left side of the button, you'll increase a point, and the right is to go down a point. </br> </hr>
      Of course, if you don't get the game, please ask me any questions and i'll be happy to help ;]
